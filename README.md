# DMDTools

A Julia package for describing the basic operation of digital micromirror devices.  These are commonly used on cold atom experiments there days, but they don't quite function like normal targets that are imaged, so this package is designed for idealized modeling of these devices.  This can be combined with other packages to deal with imaging aberrations.
